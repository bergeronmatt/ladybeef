                    <p>"Alyssa has been my online trainer for the last six months and I couldn’t be more pleased with my experience and results. She also programs my nutrition which I feel has made a huge difference in my progress and energy level. I’m not on a “diet” and I’m never hungry. I truly enjoy the workouts that I’m doing and always feel challenged. My workouts are personalized and tailored to my goals as well as the equipment that I have available at my home gym. She has worked with me through injuries and medical issues, providing modifications and adjustments as needed to allow me to stay on track. Being a nurse, I truly appreciate her wealth of knowledge in this field, she really knows the science behind fitness and nutrition. In my opinion this is what sets her apart from the rest. I’m thankful to have found a wonderful coach and friend!"</p>

                    <p>"Alyssa, aka COACH, is a phenomenal coach! I attempted to program my own workouts for years just to end up injured and not gaining the muscle I wanted. In my first six weeks, Alyssa had programmed macros and a routine that helped me lose the weight that I was struggling with while gaining a physique I was wanting. Cycle after cycle I have hit PRs, stayed healthy, and received thoughtful encouragement from Alyssa every week. She also puts up with my thousands of left field questions and adjusts on the fly to my random schedule changes. Truly a great coach, resource, and most of all, friend!"</p>

                    <p>"Alyssa is the BEST personal trainer. She’s so personable and always knows the right thing to say and pushes you when you feel like you can’t do it. She’s great at explaining how to do your workouts and always updating my workouts for the following week right away. I’m so happy that I found Alyssa and I can’t wait for my progress and improvement for months to come! My favorite thing about her is that she’s not only a trainer but she’s a friend that truly truly cares about her clients."</p>

                    <p>"I have been working out with personal trainers for almost about 6 years now and I have never come across one like Alyssa! She is so intelligent, friendly, and genuine. She not only knows the science and why behind fitness and nutrition, but she also knows how to successfully implement it in her programming with her clients. All the while teaching how to think of it not as an instant quick fix, but a sustainable result lifestyle change. She cares about you as a person, what’s going on in your life and tailors the program to adapt to your life and needs as they change. I have already seen changes and learned so much in such a short period of time, and cant wait to see even more! Way more than a 5 Star rating!! :)"</p>

                    <p>"Alyssa was the perfect coach that I never wanted. When I decided to compete in my first competition, I didn't want to need a coach...but I knew I probably did.
                        I reached out to Alyssa, and it's the best decision I could have made. She was there every step of the way. She answered my hundreds of questions and talked me through my mental breakdowns along the way. She guided me thru nutrition, food prep and workouts and pushed me when I lost my focus. She told me what to expect at the show...right down to tanning, posing and make-up. End result, with a lot of guidance from Alyssa, I placed in my very first show!!"</p>

                    <p>"The first time I met Alyssa was my third figure competition. I thought she looked amazing. I'm like killing myself and eating the same lame foods over and over and I still don't look like her. Then I got pregnant with my 6th baby and continued to workout the whole time I was pregnant and did tried to eat somewhat healthy. I promised myself I would never be miserable again eating the same bland food everyday. Then I read a post on Facebook Alyssa had about flexible dieting which sounded doable even though I wasn't sure it would help me. I needed something because I was breastfeeding and my diet was out of control so I decided to give it a try. Now after my 6th pregnancy, with a baby that is 8 months old, I have abs which is great but most importantly I enjoy my food. I don't eat bland dry chicken and fish everyday. I get my favorite cookie every night. I don't crave like I use to either. Alyssa is absolutely fantastic at what she does."</p>

                    <p>"Alyssa is simply the best trainer and motivator.
                        <br><br>
                        After graduation, I jumped right into work which required extensive amount of travel and long hours. I was eating out Monday to Friday and had very limited time/resources to workout. I always thought I led an semi-active lifestyle but I was nowhere I wanted to be. I knew I didn’t have the sufficient knowledge in nutrition or human anatomy. That’s when Alyssa came in. I signed up for monthly training and monthly meal plan. In a nutshell, it gave me more structure in the gym and in the kitchen/restaurant. What made my experience outstanding was Alyssa’s commitment to client service. On a weekly basis, I gave her information on where I was traveling to, general list of restaurants in that area, and whether I had access to a gym. And she did all the work. She researched on the restaurant menus to make sure I knew what to look for no matter where I was. She took note of the gym equipment I had access to in order to customize my workout. It was simply amazing. The weeks that I wasn’t on the road, I followed her meal plans which was also customized to my preference.
                        <br><br>
                        For Alyssa, there is no “one size fits all”. She makes sure the plans address your needs and concerns. If you want a personal trainer for whatever the reason may be, she would be the one you would want on your team."</p>

                    <p>"​LOVE her being my trainer. She answers my dumb questions without making me feel dumb. She’s excellent at explaining the “why” behind the sciense. She’ll keep you fully updated and informed every step of the way, and her programs WORK. Whether online or in person, she’s best personal trainer around."</p>
