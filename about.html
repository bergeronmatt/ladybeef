                <p>I'm Alyssa Parten; Florida native, but Alabama living. I'm enjoying life with
                    my husband and two fur babies. My passion is helping those who want to improve their
                    lives and health through exercise, nutrition with sustainable lifestyle changes.

            <p class="content">My approach for training my clients in person and online) is through developing a plan that fits their life and achieves their goals.
                No one should feel destroyed and defeated in their efforts to achieve their dream body. No one should have to change their schedules completely to hit the gym every day, and no one should have to give up enjoying their life to be proud of the image they see in the mirror. No one HAS to do any of these things to be in the best shape of their lives. And that's where I come in.
                
                    I have 8+ years of experience, a Bachelor's in Exercise and Sport Science, a minor in Nutrition from The University of Alabama, and am currently earning a dual Masters in Human Movement Science and Strength & Conditioning (anticipated graduation date: Fall 2020). 
                
                More importantly and far above any of that, I continuously strive to learn and utilize the most up to date research to better equip my athletes by applying evidence-based training. It is my mission to provide them with the most efficient and effective program for their level of fitness, lifestyle, athletic goals, endless results, and sustainability.
